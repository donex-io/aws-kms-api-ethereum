# aws-kms-api-ethereum

***Disclaimer:** This project is work in progress and should not be used to manage keys that hold any real value!*

This project is an AWS API that signs messages through AWS-KMS (ECDSA) that are compatible with Ethereum or other EVM-based blockchains, i.e. it uses specific pre-fixes and parameters.
